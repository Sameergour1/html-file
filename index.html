 <center><em><strong>Road Not Taken~Robert Frost</strong></em></center>
<hr></hr>
<center><p> Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
    And sorry I could not travel both
    And be one traveler, long I stood
    And looked down one as far as I could
    To where it bent in the undergrowth;</p>
    
   <p> Then took the other, as just as fair,
    And having perhaps the better claim,
    Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
    Though as for that the passing there
    Had worn them really about the same,</p>
    
    <p>And both that morning equally lay
    In leaves no step had trodden black.
    Oh, I kept the first for another day!
    Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
    I doubted if I should ever come back.</p>
    
   <p> I shall be telling this with a sigh
    Somewhere ages and ages hence:
    Two roads diverged in a wood, and I‚Äî
    I took the one less traveled by,
    And that has made all the difference.</p></center>
